It launches and interacts with a set of services from a single terminal window.

* Colorizes output for each process to help distinguish them.
* Useful for integration-test applications where you need to start up several processes and test them all.
* Built because servolux wasn't working very well for me.
* Can detect exactly when a service is successfully launched by watching the output of the process.
